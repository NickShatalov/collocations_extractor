Product of experts (PoE) is a machine learning technique. It models a probability distribution by combining the output from several simpler distributions.
It was proposed by Geoff Hinton, along with an algorithm for training the parameters of such a system.

The core idea is to combine several probability distributions ("experts") by multiplying their density functionsâ€”making the PoE classification similar to an "and" operation. This allows each expert to make decisions on the basis of a few dimensions without having to cover the full dimensionality of a problem.

This is related to (but quite different from) a mixture model, where several probability distributions are combined via an "or" operation, which is a weighted sum of their density functions.
