Learning with errors (LWE) is a problem in machine learning that is conjectured to be hard to solve. Introduced by Oded Regev in 2005 (Who won the 2018 Gödel Prize for this work), it is a generalization of the parity learning problem. Regev showed, furthermore, that the LWE problem is as hard to solve as several worst-case lattice problems. The LWE problem has recently been used as a hardness assumption to create public-key cryptosystems, such as the ring learning with errors key exchange by Peikert.

An algorithm is said to solve the LWE problem if, when given access to samples formula_1 where formula_2 (a vector of formula_3 integers modulo formula_4) and formula_5, with the assurance, for some fixed linear function formula_6 that formula_7 with high probability and deviates from it according to some known noise model, the algorithm can recreate formula_8 or some close approximation of it with high probability.

Denote by formula_9 the additive group on reals modulo one. Denote by formula_10 the distribution on formula_11 obtained by choosing a vector formula_12 uniformly at random, choosing formula_13 according to a probability distribution formula_14 on formula_15 and outputting formula_16 for some fixed vector formula_17. Here formula_18 is the standard inner product formula_19, the division is done in the field of reals (or more formally, this "division by formula_4" is notation for the group homomorphism formula_21 mapping formula_22 to formula_23), and the final addition is in formula_15.

The learning with errors problem formula_25 is to find formula_17, given access to polynomially many samples of choice from formula_10.

For every formula_28, denote by formula_29 the one-dimensional Gaussian with density function formula_30 where formula_31, and let formula_32 be the distribution on formula_15 obtained by considering formula_29 modulo one. The version of LWE considered in most of the results would be formula_35

The LWE problem described above is the "search" version of the problem. In the "decision" version (DLWE), the goal is to distinguish between noisy inner products and uniformly random samples from formula_11 (practically, some discretized version of it). Regev showed that the "decision" and "search" versions are equivalent when formula_4 is a prime bounded by some polynomial in formula_3.

Intuitively, if we have a procedure for the search problem, the decision version can be solved easily: just feed the input samples for the decision problem to the solver for the search problem. Denote the given samples by formula_39. If the solver returns a candidate formula_40, for all formula_41, calculate formula_42. If the samples are from an LWE distribution, then the results of this calculation will be distributed according formula_43, but if the samples are uniformly random, these quantities will be distributed uniformly as well.

For the other direction, given a solver for the decision problem, the search version can be solved as follows: Recover formula_40 one coordinate at a time. To obtain the first coordinate, formula_45, make a guess formula_46, and do the following. Choose a number formula_47 uniformly at random. Transform the given samples formula_39 as follows. Calculate formula_49. Send the transformed samples to the decision solver.

If the guess formula_50 was correct, the transformation takes the distribution formula_51 to itself, and otherwise, since formula_4 is prime, it takes it to the uniform distribution. So, given a polynomial-time solver for the decision problem that errs with very small probability, since formula_4 is bounded by some polynomial in formula_3, it only takes polynomial time to guess every possible value for formula_50 and use the solver to see which one is correct.

After obtaining formula_45, we follow an analogous procedure for each other coordinate formula_57. Namely, we transform our formula_58 samples the same way, and transform our formula_59 samples by calculating formula_60, where the formula_61 is in the formula_62 coordinate.

Peikert showed that this reduction, with a small modification, works for any formula_4 that is a product of distinct, small (polynomial in formula_3) primes. The main idea is if formula_65, for each formula_66, guess and check to see if formula_57 is congruent to formula_68, and then use the Chinese remainder theorem to recover formula_57.

Regev showed the Random self-reducibility of the LWE and DLWE problems for arbitrary formula_4 and formula_43. Given samples formula_72 from formula_51, it is easy to see that formula_74 are samples from formula_75.

So, suppose there was some set formula_76 such that formula_77, and for distributions formula_78, with formula_79, DLWE was easy.

Then there would be some distinguisher formula_80, who, given samples formula_81, could tell whether they were uniformly random or from formula_78. If we need to distinguish uniformly random samples from formula_51, where formula_40 is chosen uniformly at random from formula_85, we could simply try different values formula_86 sampled uniformly at random from formula_85, calculate formula_74 and feed these samples to formula_80. Since formula_90 comprises a large fraction of formula_85, with high probability, if we choose a polynomial number of values for formula_92, we will find one such that formula_93, and formula_80 will successfully distinguish the samples.

Thus, no such formula_90 can exist, meaning LWE and DLWE are (up to a polynomial factor) as hard in the average case as they are in the worst case.

For a n-dimensional lattice formula_96, let "smoothing parameter" formula_97 denote the smallest formula_98 such that formula_99 where formula_100 is the dual of formula_96 and formula_31 is extended to sets by summing over function values at each element in the set. Let formula_103 denote the discrete Gaussian distribution on formula_96 of width formula_61 for a lattice formula_96 and real formula_107. The probability of each formula_108 is proportional to formula_109.

The "discrete Gaussian sampling problem"(DGS) is defined as follows: An instance of formula_110 is given by an formula_3-dimensional lattice formula_96 and a number formula_113. The goal is to output a sample from formula_103. Regev shows that there is a reduction from formula_115 to formula_116 for any function formula_117.

Regev then shows that there exists an efficient quantum algorithm for formula_118 given access to an oracle for formula_119 for integer formula_4 and formula_121 such that formula_122. This implies the hardness for formula_123. Although the proof of this assertion works for any formula_4, for creating a cryptosystem, the formula_4 has to be polynomial in formula_3.

Peikert proves that there is a probabilistic polynomial time reduction from the formula_127 problem in the worst case to solving formula_119 using formula_129 samples for parameters formula_121, formula_131, formula_132 and formula_133.

The LWE problem serves as a versatile problem used in construction of several cryptosystems. In 2005, Regev showed that the decision version of LWE is hard assuming quantum hardness of the lattice problems formula_134 (for formula_135 as above) and formula_136 with t=Õ(n/formula_137). In 2009, Peikert proved a similar result assuming only the classical hardness of the related problem formula_127. The disadvantage of Peikert's result is that it bases itself on a non-standard version of an easier (when compared to SIVP) problem GapSVP.

Regev proposed a public-key cryptosystem based on the hardness of the LWE problem. The cryptosystem as well as the proof of security and correctness are completely classical. The system is characterized by formula_139 and a probability distribution formula_43 on formula_15. The setting of the parameters used in proofs of correctness and security is

The cryptosystem is then defined by:

The proof of correctness follows from choice of parameters and some probability analysis. The proof of security is by reduction to the decision version of LWE: an algorithm for distinguishing between encryptions (with above parameters) of formula_161 and formula_165 can be used to distinguish between formula_168 and the uniform distribution over formula_169

Peikert proposed a system that is secure even against any chosen-ciphertext attack.

The idea of using LWE and Ring LWE for key exchange was proposed and filed at the University of Cincinnati in 2011 by Jintai Ding. The idea comes from the associativity of matrix multiplications, and the errors are used to provide the security. The paper appeared in 2012 after a provisional patent application was filed in 2012.

The security of the protocol is proven based on the hardness of solving the LWE problem. In 2014, Peikert presented a key-transport scheme following the same basic idea of Ding's, where the new idea of sending an additional 1-bit signal for rounding in Ding's construction is also used. The "new hope" implementation selected for Google's post-quantum experiment, uses Peikert's scheme with variation in the error distribution.
