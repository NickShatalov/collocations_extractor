discriminative model also call conditional model be a class of model use in machine learn for model the dependence of unobserved target variable formula on observed variable formula . within a probabilistic framework this is do by model the conditional probability distribution formula which can be use for predicting formula from formula . discriminative model a oppose to generative model do not allow one to generate sample from the joint distribution of observed and target variable . however for task such a classification and regression that do not require the joint distribution discriminative model can yield superior performance in part because they have few variable to compute . on the other hand generative model be typically more flexible than discriminative model in express dependency in complex learn task . in addition most discriminative model are inherently supervise and cannot easily support unsupervised learn . applicationspecific detail ultimately dictate the suitability of select a discriminative versus generative model . example of discriminative model use in machine learn include .
