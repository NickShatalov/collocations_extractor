in machine learn instancebased learn sometimes call memorybased learning be a family of learn algorithm that instead of perform explicit generalization compare new problem instance with instance see in train which have be store in memory . it is call instancebased because it construct hypotheses directly from the training instance themselves . this mean that the hypothesis complexity can grow with the data in the bad case a hypothesis be a list of n train item and the computational complexity of classify a single new instance be on . one advantage that instancebased learn have over other method of machine learning be it ability to adapt it model to previously unseen data . instancebased learner may simply store a new instance or throw an old instance away . example of instancebased learn algorithm be the knearest neighbor algorithm kernel machine and rbf network . these store a subset of their training set when predict a valueclass for a new instance they compute distance or similarity between this instance and the training instance to make a decision . to battle the memory complexity of store all training instance as well a the risk of overfitting to noise in the training set instance reduction algorithm have been propose . gagliardi apply this family of classifier in medical field a secondopinion diagnostic tool and a tool for the knowledge extraction phase in the process of knowledge discovery in database . one of these classifier call prototype exemplar learn classifier pelc be able to extract a mixture of abstract prototypical case that be syndrome and select atypical clinical case .
