in machine learn multipleinstance learn mil be a variation on supervised learning . instead of receive a set of instance which are individually label the learner receive a set of label bag each contain many instance . in the simple case of multipleinstance binary classification a bag may be label negative if all the instance in it be negative . on the other hand a bag is label positive if there be at least one instance in it which be positive . from a collection of label bag the learner try to either i induce a concept that will label individual instance correctly or ii learn how to label bag without inducing the concept . take image classification for example in . give an image we want to know it target class base on it visual content . for instance the target class might be beach where the image contain both sand and water . in mil term the image is describe a a bag formula where eachformula be the feature vector call instance extract from the correspond ith region in the image and n be the total region instance partition the image . the bag is label positive beach if it contain both sand region instance and water region instance . multipleinstance learning wa originally propose under this name by but early example of similar research exist for instance in the work on handwritten digit recognition by . recent review of the mil literature include which provide an extensive review and comparative study of the different paradigm and which provide a thorough review of the different assumption use by different paradigm in the literature . example of where mil is apply arenumerous researcher have work on adapt classical classification technique such a support vector machine or boost to work within the context of multipleinstance learn .
