bayesian structural time series bsts model be a machine learning technique use for feature selection time series forecasting nowcasting infer causal impact and other . the model is design to work with time series data . the model ha also promise application in the field of analytical marketing . in particular it can be use in order to assess how much different marketing campaign have contribute to the change in web search volume product sale brand popularity and other relevant indicator differenceindifferences model be a usual alternative approach in this case . in contrast to classical differenceindifferences scheme statespace model make it possible to i infer the temporal evolution of attributable impact ii incorporate empirical prior on the parameter in a fully bayesian treatment and iii flexibly accommodate multiple source of variation include the timevarying influence of contemporaneous covariates i . synthetic control . the model consists of three main partsthe model seem to discover not only correlation but also causations in the underlying data . a possible drawback of the model can be it relatively complicate mathematical underpinning and difficult implementation a a computer program . however the programming language r have readytouse package for calculate the bsts model which do not require strong mathematical background from a researcher .
