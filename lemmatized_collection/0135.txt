formulaformula with formulaand formula go to zero for formulax and y r be respectively an input and an output space we consider a training set formulaof size m in formula drawn i . from an unknown distribution d . a learning algorithm be a function formula from formula into formulawhich map a learning set s onto a function formula from x to y . to avoid complex notation we consider only deterministic algorithm . it be also assume that the algorithm formula be symmetric with respect to s i . it doe not depend on the order of the element in the training set . furthermore we assume that all function be measurable and all set be countable which doe not limit the interest of the result present here . the loss of an hypothesis f with respect to an example formula is then define a formula . the empirical error of f be formula . the true error of f is formulagiven a training set s of size m we will build for all i . m modify training set a followsformulaformula .
