caffe convolutional architecture for fast feature embedding be a deep learn framework originally develop at uc berkeley . it be open source under a bsd license . it is write in c with a python interface . yangqing jia create the caffe project during his phd at uc berkeley . now there be many contributor to the project and it is host at github . caffe support many different type of deep learning architecture gear towards image classification and image segmentation . it support cnn rcnn lstm and fully connect neural network design . caffe support gpu and cpubased acceleration computational kernel library such a nvidia cudnn and intel mkl . caffe is being use in academic research project startup prototype and even largescale industrial application in vision speech and multimedia . yahoo ha also integrate caffe with apache spark to create caffeonspark a distribute deep learn framework . in april facebook announced caffe which include new feature such a recurrent neural network . end of march caffe wa merge into pytorch .
