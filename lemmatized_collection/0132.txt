roboearth be a network and database repository where robot can share information and learn from each other and a cloud for outsourcing heavy computation task . the project that ha be describe a a world wide web for robot . the project brings together researcher from five major university in germany the netherlands and spain and is back by the european union . it allow robot toin addition to the cloudbased infrastructure roboearth offer roscompatible robotunspecific component for high level control of the robot . see softwarecomponents for more detail . roboearth offer a cloud robotics infrastructure which include everything need to close the loop from robot to the cloud and back to the robot . roboearths worldwideweb style database store knowledge generate by human and robot in a machinereadable format . data store in the roboearth knowledge base include software component map for navigation e . object location world model task knowledge e . action recipes manipulation strategy and object recognition model e . image object model . the roboearth cloud engine also call rapyuta make powerful computation available to robot . it allow robot to offload their heavy computation to secure compute environment in the cloud with minimal configuration . the cloud engine compute environment provide high bandwidth access to the roboearth knowledge repository enabling robot to benefit from the experience of other robotsin late the roboearth project wa award a year funding grant from the european commission cognitive system and robotics initiative in order to develop their network database platform rapyuta and to develop proofofconcept system to demonstrate it use . in january it wa officially announce that wikipedia for robot had been launch . roboearth have a spin off call robohow .
