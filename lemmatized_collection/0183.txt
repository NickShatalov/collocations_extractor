domain adaptation be a field associate with machine learn and transfer learn . this scenario arise when we aim at learn from a source data distribution a well perform model on a different but related target data distribution . for instance one of the task of the common spam filter problem consists in adapt a model from one user the source distribution to a new one who receive significantly different email the target distribution . note that when more than one source distribution be available the problem is refer to a multisource domain adaptation . let formula be the input space or description space and let formula be the output space or label space . the objective of a machine learn algorithm be to learn a mathematical model a hypothesis formula able to affect a label of formula to an example from formula . this model is learn from a learning sample formula . usually in supervise learn without domain adaptation we suppose that the example formula be drawn i . from a distribution formula of support formula unknown and fix . the objective be then to learn formula from formula such that it commit the least error a possible for label new example come from the distribution formula . the main difference between supervise learn and domain adaptation be that in the latter situation we study two different but related distribution formula and formula on formula . the domain adaptation task then consists of the transfer of knowledge from the source domain formula to the target one formula . the goal be then to learn formula from label or unlabelled sample come from the two domain such that it commit a little error a possible on the target domain formula . the major issue be the follow if a model is learn from a source domain what be it capacity to correctly label data come from the target domainthere be several context of domain adaptation . they differ in the information consider for the target task . the objective be to reweight the source label sample such that it look like the target sample in term of the error measure considereda method for adapt consists in iteratively autolabeling the target example . the principle be simplenote that there exist other iterative approach but they usually need target labeled example . the goal be to find or construct a common representation space for the two domain . the objective be to obtain a space in which the domain be close to each other while keep good performance on the source labeling task . this can be achieve through the use of adversarial machine learning technique where feature representation from sample in different domain are encourage to be indistinguishable .
