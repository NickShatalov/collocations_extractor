in computer science a predictive state representation psr be a way to model a state of control dynamical system from a history of action take and result observation . psr capture the state of a system a a vector of prediction for future test experiment that can be do on the system . a test be a sequence of actionobservation pair and it prediction be the probability of the test observationsequence happen if the test actionsequence be to be execute on the system . one of the advantage of use psr be that the prediction be directly related to observable quantity . this be in contrast to other model of dynamical system such a partially observable markov decision process pomdps where the state of the system is represent a a probability distribution over unobserved nominal state .
