data exploration be an approach similar to initial data analysis whereby a data analyst use visual exploration to understand what be in a dataset and the characteristic of the data rather than through traditional data management system . these characteristic can include size or amount of data completeness of the data correctness of the data possible relationship amongst data element or filestables in the data . data exploration is typically conduct use a combination of automated and manual activity . automated activity can include data profile or data visualization or tabular report to give the analyst an initial view into the data and an understanding of key characteristic . this is often follow by manual drilldown or filter of the data to identify anomaly or pattern identify through the automated action . data exploration can also require manual scripting and query into the data e . use language such a sql or r or use excel or similar tool to view the raw data . all of these activity are aim at create a clear mental model and understand of the data in the mind of the analyst and define basic metadata statistic structure relationship for the data set that can be use in further analysis . once this initial understanding of the data is have the data can be prune or refine by remove unusable part of the data correct poorly format element and define relevant relationship across datasets . this process be also known a determining data quality . data exploration can also refer to the ad hoc query and visualization of data to identify potential relationship or insight that may be hidden in the data . traditionally this had be a key area of focus for statistician with john tukey be a key evangelist in the field . today data exploration be more widespread and be the focus of data analyst and data scientist the latter be a relatively new role within enterprise and large organization . this area of data exploration ha become an area of interest in the field of machine learn . this be a relatively new field and be still evolving . a it most basic level a machinelearning algorithm can be feed a data set and can be use to identify whether a hypothesis is true base on the dataset . common machine learn algorithm can focus on identify specific pattern in the data . many common pattern include regression and classification or clustering but there be many possible pattern and algorithm that can be apply to data via machine learn . by employ machine learn it be possible to find pattern or relationship in the data that would be difficult or impossible to find via manual inspection trial and error or traditional exploration technique .
