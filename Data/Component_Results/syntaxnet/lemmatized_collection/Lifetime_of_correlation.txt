the lifetime of correlation measure the timespan over which there be appreciable autocorrelation or cross correlation in stochastic process . the correlation coefficient express a an autocorrelation function or crosscorrelation function depend on the lagtime between the time being consider . typically such function t decay to zero with increase lagtime but they can assume value across all level of correlation strong and weak and positive and negative a in the table . the lifetime of a correlation is define a the length of time when the correlation coefficient be at the strong level . the durability of correlation is determine by signal the strong level of correlation is separate from weak and negative level . the mean lifetime of correlation could measure how the durability of correlation depends on the window width size the window be the length of time series use to calculate correlation .
