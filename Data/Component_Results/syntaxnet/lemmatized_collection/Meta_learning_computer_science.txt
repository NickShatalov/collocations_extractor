meta learning be a subfield of machine learn where automatic learn algorithm are apply on metadata about machine learn experiment . a of the term had not find a standard interpretation however the main goal be to use such metadata to understand how automatic learn can become flexible in solving learning problem hence to improve the performance of existing learn algorithm or to learn induce the learn algorithm itself hence the alternative term learn to learn . flexibility be important because each learning algorithm is base on a set of assumption about the data it inductive bias . this mean that it will only learn well if the bias match the learn problem . a learning algorithm may perform very well in one domain but not on the next . this pose strong restriction on the use of machine learn or data mining technique since the relationship between the learn problem often some kind of database and the effectiveness of different learning algorithm be not yet understood . by use different kind of metadata like property of the learn problem algorithm property like performance measure or pattern previously derive from the data it be possible to learn select alter or combine different learning algorithm to effectively solve a give learn problem . critique of meta learn approach bear a strong resemblance to the critique of metaheuristic a possibly related problem . a good analogy to metalearning and the inspiration for bengio et al . s early work consider that genetic evolution learn the learning procedure encode in gene and execute in each individual brain . a propose definition for a meta learn system combine three requirement . bias refer to the assumption that influence the choice of explanatory hypothesis and not the notion of bias represent in the biasvariance dilemma . meta learning be concerned with two aspect of learn bias . some approach which have be view a instance of meta learn .
