random indexing be a dimensionality reduction method and computational framework for distributional semantics base on the insight that veryhighdimensional vector space model implementation be impractical that model need not grow in dimensionality when new item e . new terminology is encounter and that a highdimensional model can be project into a space of low dimensionality without compromise l distance metric if the resulting dimension are choose appropriately . this be the original point of the random projection approach to dimension reduction first formulate a the johnsonlindenstrauss lemma and localitysensitive hashing have some of the same starting point . random index a use in representation of language originates from the work of pentti kanerva on sparse distributed memory and can be describe a an incremental formulation of a random projection . it can be also verify that random indexing be a random projection technique for the construction of euclidean spacesi . l normed vector space . in euclidean space random projection are elucidate use the johnsonlindenstrauss lemma . the topsig technique extend the random indexing model to produce bit vector for comparison with the hamming distance similarity function . it is use for improve the performance of information retrieval and document cluster . in a similar line of research random manhattan integer indexing rmii is propose for improve the performance of the method that employ the manhattan distance between text unit . many random indexing method primarily generate similarity from cooccurrence of item in a corpus . reflexive random index rri generates similarity from cooccurrence and from shared occurrence with other item .
