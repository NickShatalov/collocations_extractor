automate machine learn automl be the process of automate the endtoend process of apply machine learn to realworld problem . in a typical machine learn application practitioner must apply the appropriate data preprocessing feature engineering feature extraction and feature selection method that make the dataset amenable for machine learn . follow those preprocessing step practitioner must then perform algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization to maximize the predictive performance of their final machine learn model . as many of these step are often beyond the ability of nonexperts automl wa propose a an artificial intelligencebased solution to the evergrowing challenge of apply machine learn . automate the endtoend process of apply machine learn offer the advantage of produce simple solution faster creation of those solution and model that often outperform model that were design by hand . automated machine learning can target various stage of the machine learn process . software tackle various stage of automl .
