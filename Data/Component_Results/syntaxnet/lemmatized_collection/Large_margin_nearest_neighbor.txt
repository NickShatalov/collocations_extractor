in artificial intelligence eager learning be a learning method in which the system try to construct a general inputindependent target function during training of the system a oppose to lazy learn where generalization beyond the training data is delay until a query is make to the system . the main advantage gain in employ an eager learn method such a an artificial neural network be that the target function will be approximate globally during train thus require much le space than use a lazy learn system . eager learning system also deal much good with noise in the training data . eager learning be an example of offline learn in which posttraining query to the system have no effect on the system itself and thus the same query to the system will always produce the same result . the main disadvantage with eager learning be that it be generally unable to provide good local approximation in the target function .
