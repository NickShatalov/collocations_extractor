proaftn be a fuzzy classification method that belong to the class of supervised learn algorithm . the acronym proaftn stand for procdure daffectation floue pour la problmatique du tri nominal which mean in english fuzzy assignment procedure for nominal sorting . the method enables to determine the fuzzy indifference relation by generalize the index concordance and discordance use in the electre iii method . to determine the fuzzy indifference relation proaftn use the general scheme of the discretization technique described in that establish a set of preclassified case call a training set . to resolve the classification problem proaftn proceeds by the follow stage . stage . model of class in this stage the prototype of the class are conceive use the two follow step . direct technique it consist in adjust the parameter through the training set and with the expert intervention . indirect technique it consist in fit the parameter without the expert intervention a use in machine learn approach . in multicriteria classification problem the indirect technique be known a preference disaggregation analysis . this technique require less cognitive effort than the former technique it use an automatic method to determine the optimal parameter which minimize the classification error . furthermore several heuristic and metaheuristics were use to learn the multicriteria classification method proaftn . stage . assignment after conceive the prototype proaftn proceeds to assign the new object to specific class .
