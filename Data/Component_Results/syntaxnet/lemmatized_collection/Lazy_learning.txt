in machine learn lazy learn be a learning method in which generalization of the training data is delay until a query is make to the system a oppose to in eager learn where the system try to generalize the training data before receive query . the main advantage gain in employ a lazy learn method such a casebased reason be that the target function will be approximate locally such a in the knearest neighbor algorithm . because the target function is approximate locally for each query to the system lazy learn system can simultaneously solve multiple problem and deal successfully with change in the problem domain . the disadvantage with lazy learn include the large space requirement to store the entire train dataset . particularly noisy training data increase the case base unnecessarily because no abstraction is make during the training phase . another disadvantage be that lazy learn method be usually slow to evaluate though this is couple with a faster training phase . lazy classifier be most useful for large datasets with few attribute .
