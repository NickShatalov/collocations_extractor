the follow outline is provide a an overview of and topical guide to machine learningmachine learning subfield of computer science more particularly soft compute that evolve from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence . in arthur samuel define machine learn a a field of study that give computer the ability to learn without be explicitly programmed . machine learning explore the study and construction of algorithm that can learn from and make prediction on data . such algorithm operate by build a model from an example training set of input observation in order to make datadriven prediction or decision expressed a output rather than follow strictly static program instruction . subfields of machine learningcrossdisciplinary field involving machine learningapplications of machine learningmachine learning hardwaremachine learning tool listmachine learning frameworkproprietary machine learning frameworksopen source machine learning frameworksmachine learning library machine learning algorithmmachine learning method listdimensionality reductionensemble learningmeta learningreinforcement learningsupervised learningbayesian statisticsdecision tree algorithmlinear classifierunsupervised learningartificial neural networkassociation rule learninghierarchical clusteringcluster analysisanomaly detectionsemisupervised learningdeep learningmachine learning researchhistory of machine learningmachine learning projectsmachine learning organizationsbooks about machine learn .
