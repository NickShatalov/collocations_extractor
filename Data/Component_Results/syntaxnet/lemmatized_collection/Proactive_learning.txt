proactive learning be a generalization of active learning design to relax unrealistic assumption and thereby reach practical application . active learning seek to select the most informative unlabeled instance and ask an omniscient oracle for their label so a to retrain a learning algorithm maximizing accuracy . however the oracle is assume to be infallible never wrong indefatigable always answer individual only one oracle and insensitive to cost always free or always charge the same . in real life it be possible and more general to have multiple source of information with differing reliability or area of expertise . active learn also assume that the single oracle be perfect always provide a correct answer when request . in reality though an oracle if we generalize the term to mean any source of expert information may be incorrect fallible . with a probability that should be a function of the difficulty of the question . moreover an oracle may be reluctant it may refuse to answer if it be too uncertain or too busy . finally active learn presumes the oracle be either free or charge uniform cost in label elicitation . such an assumption be naive since cost be likely to be regulate by difficulty amount of work require to formulate an answer or other factor . proactive learning relaxes all four of these assumption rely on a decisiontheoretic approach to jointly select the optimal oracle and instance by cast the problem a a utility optimization problem subject to a budget constraint .
