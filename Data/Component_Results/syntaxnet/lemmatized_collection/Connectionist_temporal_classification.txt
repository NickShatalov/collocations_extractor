connectionist temporal classification ctc be a type of neural network output and associate scoring function for train recurrent neural network rnns such a lstm network to tackle sequence problem where the timing be variable . it can be use for task like online handwrite recognition or recognize phoneme in speech audio . ctc refer to the output and scoring and be independent of the underlie neural network structure . it wa introduce in . the input be a sequence of observation and the output be a sequence of label which can include blank output . the difficulty of train come from there be many more observation than there be label . for example in speech audio there can be multiple time slice which correspond to a single phoneme . since we dont know the alignment of the observe sequence with the target label we predict a probability distribution at each time step . a ctc network have a continuous output e . softmax which is fit through train to model the probability of a label . ctc doe not attempt to learn boundary and timing label sequence are consider equivalent if they differ only in alignment ignore blank . equivalent label sequence can occur in many way which make score a nontrivial task . fortunately there be an efficient forwardbackward algorithm for that . ctc score can then be use with the backpropagation algorithm to update the neural network weight . alternative approach to a ctcfitted neural network include a hidden markov model hmm .
