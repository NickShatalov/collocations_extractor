wordvec be a group of related model that are use to produce word embeddings . these model are shallow twolayer neural network that are train to reconstruct linguistic context of word . wordvec take a it input a large corpus of text and produce a vector space typically of several hundred dimension with each unique word in the corpus being assign a corresponding vector in the space . word vector are position in the vector space such that word that share common context in the corpus are locate in close proximity to one another in the space . wordvec wa create by a team of researcher lead by tomas mikolov at google . the algorithm ha be subsequently analysed and explain by other researcher . embed vector create use the wordvec algorithm have many advantage compare to early algorithm such a latent semantic analysis . wordvec can utilize either of two model architecture to produce a distribute representation of word continuous bagofwords cbow or continuous skipgram . in the continuous bagofwords architecture the model predict the current word from a window of surround context word . the order of context word doe not influence prediction bagofwords assumption . in the continuous skipgram architecture the model use the current word to predict the surrounding window of context word . the skipgram architecture weigh nearby context word more heavily than more distant context word . accord to the author note cbow be faster while skipgram be slower but do a good job for infrequent word . result of wordvec training can be sensitive to parametrization . the follow be some important parameter in wordvec training . a wordvec model can be train with hierarchical softmax andor negative sampling . to approximate the conditional loglikelihood a model seek to maximize the hierarchical softmax method use a huffman tree to reduce calculation . the negative sampling method on the other hand approach the maximization problem by minimize the loglikelihood of sample negative instance . accord to the author hierarchical softmax work good for infrequent word while negative sampling work good for frequent word and good with low dimensional vector . a training epoch increase hierarchical softmax stop be useful . high frequency word often provide little information . word with frequency above a certain threshold may be subsampled to increase training speed . quality of word embed increase with high dimensionality . but after reach some point marginal gain will diminish . typically the dimensionality of the vector be set to be between and . the size of the context window determines how many word before and after a given word would be include a context word of the give word . accord to the author note the recommended value be for skipgram and for cbow . an extension of wordvec to construct embeddings from entire document rather than the individual word ha been propose . this extension is call paragraphvec or docvec and ha been implement in the c python and javascala tool see below with the java and python version also supporting inference of document embeddings on new unseen document . an extension of word vector for ngrams in biological sequence e . dna rna and protein for bioinformatics application have been propose by asgari and mofrad . name biovectors biovec to refer to biological sequence in general with proteinvectors protvec for protein aminoacid sequence and genevectors genevec for gene sequence this representation can be widely use in application of machine learn in proteomics and genomics . the result suggest that biovectors can characterize biological sequence in term of biochemical and biophysical interpretation of the underlying pattern . an extension of word vector for create a dense vector representation of unstructured radiology report ha been propose by banerjee et . al . one of the biggest challenge with wordvec be how to handle unknown or outofvocabulary oov word and morphologically similar word . this can particularly be an issue in domain like medicine where synonym and related word can be use depend on the preferred style of radiologist and word may have been use infrequently in a large corpus . if the wordvec model ha not encounter a particular word before it will be force to use a random vector which be generally far from it ideal representation . iwe combine wordvec with a semantic dictionary mapping technique to tackle the major challenge of information extraction from clinical text which include ambiguity of free text narrative style lexical variation use of ungrammatical and telegraphic phase arbitrary ordering of word and frequent appearance of abbreviation and acronym . of particular interest the iwe model train on the one institutional dataset successfully translate to a different institutional dataset which demonstrate good generalizability of the approach across institution . the reason for successful word embedding learn in the wordvec framework be poorly understood . goldberg and levy point out that the wordvec objective function cause word that occur in similar context to have similar embeddings a measure by cosine similarity and note that this be in line with j . firths distributional hypothesis . however they note that this explanation be very handwavy and argue that a more formal explanation would be preferable . levy et al . show that much of the superior performance of wordvec or similar embeddings in downstream task be not a result of the model per se but of the choice of specific hyperparameters . transfer these hyperparameters to more traditional approach yield similar performance in downstream task . the word embed approach be able to capture multiple different degree of similarity between word . mikolov et al . find that semantic and syntactic pattern can be reproduce use vector arithmetic . pattern such a man be to woman a brother be to sister can be generate through algebraic operation on the vector representation of these word such that the vector representation of brother man woman produce a result which be close to the vector representation of sister in the model . such relationship can be generate for a range of semantic relation such a countrycapital as well a syntactic relation e . present tensepast tense . mikolov et al . develop an approach to assess the quality of a wordvec model which draw on the semantic and syntactic pattern discuss above . they develop a set of semantic relation and syntactic relation which they use a a benchmark to test the accuracy of a model . when assess the quality of a vector model a user may draw on this accuracy test which be implement in wordvec or develop their own test set which be meaningful to the corpus which make up the model . this approach offer a more challenge test than simply argue that the word most similar to a give test word be intuitively plausible . the use of different model parameter and different corpus size can greatly affect the quality of a wordvec model . accuracy can be improve in a number of way include the choice of model architecture cbow or skipgram increase the training data set increase the number of vector dimension and increase the window size of word consider by the algorithm . each of these improvement come with the cost of increase computational complexity and therefore increase model generation time . in model use large corpus and a high number of dimension the skipgram model yield the high overall accuracy and consistently produce the high accuracy on semantic relationship as well a yield the high syntactic accuracy in most case . however the cbow be less computationally expensive and yield similar accuracy result . accuracy increase overall a the number of word use increase and a the number of dimension increase . mikolov et al . report that double the amount of train data result in an increase in computational complexity equivalent to double the number of vector dimension . altszyler et al . study wordvec performance in two semantic test for different corpus size . they find that wordvec have a steep learn curve outperform another wordembedding technique lsa when it is train with medium to large corpus size more than million word . however with a small training corpus lsa show good performance . additionally they show that the best parameter setting depend on the task and the training corpus . nevertheless for skipgram model train in medium size corpus with dimension a window size of and negative sample seem to be a good parameter set .
