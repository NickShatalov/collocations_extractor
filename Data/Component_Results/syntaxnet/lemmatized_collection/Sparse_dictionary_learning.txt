sparse dictionary learning be a representation learn method which aim at find a sparse representation of the input data also know a sparse coding in the form of a linear combination of basic element as well a those basic element themselves . these element are call atom and they compose a dictionary . atoms in the dictionary are not require to be orthogonal and they may be an overcomplete span set . this problem setup also allow the dimensionality of the signal being represent to be high than the one of the signal being observe . the above two property lead to have seemingly redundant atoms that allow multiple representation of the same signal but also provide an improvement in sparsity and flexibility of the representation . one of the most important application of sparse dictionary learn be in the field of compressed sensing or signal recovery . in compressed sense a high dimensional signal can be recover with only a few linear measurement provide that the signal be sparse or nearly sparse . since not all signal satisfy this sparsity condition it be of great importance to find a sparse representation of that signal such a the wavelet transform or the directional gradient of a rasterize matrix . once a matrix or a high dimensional vector is transfer to a sparse space different recovery algorithm like basis pursuit cosamp or fast noniterative algorithm can be use to recover the signal . one of the key principle of dictionary learn be that the dictionary have to be infer from the input data . the emergence of sparse dictionary learn method wa stimulate by the fact that in signal processing one typically want to represent the input data use a few component a possible . before this approach the general practice be to use predefined dictionary such a fourier or wavelet transforms . however in certain case a dictionary that is train to fit the input data can significantly improve the sparsity which have application in data decomposition compression and analysis and ha been use in the field of image denoising and classification video and audio processing . sparsity and overcomplete dictionary have immense application in image compression image fusion and inpainting . give the input dataset formula we wish to find a dictionary formula and a representation formula such that both formula be minimized and the representation formula be sparse enough . this can be formulate a the follow optimization problem . formula where formula . formula is require to constrain formula so that it atom would not reach arbitrarily high value allow for arbitrarily low but nonzero value of formula . the minimization problem above is not convex because of the norm and solve this problem be nphard . in some case lnorm is know to ensure sparsity and so the above become a convex optimization problem with respect to each of the variable formula and formula when the other one is fix but it is not jointly convex in formula . the dictionary formula define above can be undercomplete if formula or overcomplete in case formula with the latter be a typical assumption for a sparse dictionary learn problem . the case of a complete dictionary doe not provide any improvement from a representational point of view and thus isnt consider . undercomplete dictionary represent the setup in which the actual input data lie in a lowerdimensional space . this case be strongly related to dimensionality reduction and technique like principal component analysis which require atoms formula to be orthogonal . the choice of these subspace be crucial for efficient dimensionality reduction but it be not trivial . and dimensionality reduction base on dictionary representation can be extend to address specific task such a data analysis or classification . however their main downside be limit the choice of atom . overcomplete dictionary however do not require the atom to be orthogonal they will never be a basis anyway thus allowing for more flexible dictionary and rich data representation . an overcomplete dictionary which allow for sparse representation of signal can be a famous transform matrix wavelets transform fourier transform or it can be formulate so that it element are change in such a way that it sparsely represents give signal in a best way . learn dictionary be capable to give more sparse solution a compare to predefined transform matrix . a the optimization problem describe above can be solve a a convex problem with respect to either dictionary or sparse coding while the other one of the two is fix most of the algorithm are base on the idea of iteratively update one and then the other . the problem of find an optimal sparse coding formula with a give dictionary formula be known a sparse approximation or sometimes just sparse cod problem . there ha been develop a number of algorithm to solve it such a match pursuit and lasso which are incorporate into the algorithm describe below . the method of optimal direction or mod be one of the first method introduced to tackle the sparse dictionary learn problem . the core idea of it be to solve the minimization problem subject to the limit number of nonzero component of the representation vector . formula . here formula denote the frobenius norm . mod alternate between get the sparse coding use a method such a match pursuit and update the dictionary by compute the analytical solution of the problem give by formula where formula be a moorepenrose pseudoinverse . after this update formula is renormalize to fit the constraint and the new sparse coding is obtain again . the process is repeat until convergence or until a sufficiently small residue . mod ha prove to be a very efficient method for lowdimensional input data formula require just a few iteration to converge . however due to the high complexity of the matrixinversion operation compute the pseudoinverse in highdimensional case be in many case intractable . this shortcoming ha inspire the development of other dictionary learn method . ksvd be an algorithm that performs svd at it core to update the atom of the dictionary one by one and basically be a generalization of kmeans . it enforce that each element of the input data formula is encode by a linear combination of not more than formula element in a way identical to the mod approach . formula . this algorithm essence be to first fix the dictionary find the best possible formula under the above constraint using orthogonal matching pursuit and then iteratively update the atom of dictionary formula in the follow manner . formula . the next step of the algorithm include rank approximation of the residual matrix formula updating formula and enforce the sparsity of formula after the update . this algorithm is consider to be standard for dictionary learning and is use in a variety of application . however it share weakness with mod be efficient only for signal with relatively low dimensionality and have the possibility for be stuck at local minimum . one can also apply a widespread stochastic gradient descent method with iterative projection to solve this problem . the idea of this method be to update the dictionary use the first order stochastic gradient and project it on the constraint set formula . the step that occur at ith iteration is describe by this expression . formula where formula be a random subset of formula and formula be a gradient step . an algorithm base on solve a dual lagrangian problem provides an efficient way to solve for the dictionary have no complication induce by the sparsity function . consider the follow lagrangian . formula where formula be a constraint on the norm of the atom and formula be the socalled dual variable form the diagonal matrix formula . we can then provide an analytical expression for the lagrange dual after minimization over formula . formula . after apply one of the optimization method to the value of the dual such a newton method or conjugate gradient we get the value of formula . formula . solve this problem be less computational hard because the amount of dual variable formula be a lot of time much less than the amount of variable in the primal problem . parametric training method are aim to incorporate the best of both world the realm of analytically constructed dictionary and the learn one . this allow to construct more powerful generalize dictionary that can potentially be apply to the case of arbitrarysized signal . notable approach include . many common approach to sparse dictionary learn rely on the fact that the whole input data formula or at least a large enough training dataset be available for the algorithm . however this might not be the case in the realworld scenario a the size of the input data might be too big to fit it into memory . the other case where this assumption can not be make be when the input data come in a form of a stream . such case lie in the field of study of online learn which essentially suggest iteratively update the model upon the new data point formula become available . a dictionary can be learn in an online manner the follow way . this method allow u to gradually update the dictionary a new data become available for sparse representation learn and help drastically reduce the amount of memory need to store the dataset which often have a huge size . the dictionary learn framework namely the linear decomposition of an input signal use a few basis element learn from data itself ha lead to stateofart result in various image and video process task . this technique can be apply to classification problem in a way that if we have build specific dictionary for each class the input signal can be classify by find the dictionary correspond to the sparse representation . it also have property that be useful for signal denoising since usually one can learn a dictionary to represent the meaningful part of the input signal in a sparse way but the noise in the input will have a much le sparse representation . sparse dictionary learn ha be successfully apply to various image video and audio process task as well a to texture synthesis and unsupervised clustering . in evaluation with the bagofwords model sparse coding wa find empirically to outperform other cod approach on the object category recognition task . dictionary learning is use to analyse medical signal in detail . such medical signal include those from electroencephalography eeg electrocardiography ecg magnetic resonance imaging mri functional mri fmri and ultrasound computer tomography usct where different assumption are use to analyze each signal .
