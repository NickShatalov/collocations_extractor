nativelanguage identification nli be the task of determine an author native language l base only on their writing in a second language l . nli work through identify languageusage pattern that be common to specific l group and then apply this knowledge to predict the native language of previously unseen text . this is motivate in part by application in secondlanguage acquisition language teaching and forensic linguistics amongst others . nli work under the assumption that an author l will dispose them towards particular language production pattern in their l a influence by their native language . this relates to crosslinguistic influence cli a key topic in the field of secondlanguage acquisition sla that analyze transfer effect from the l on later learn language . use largescale english data nli method achieve over accuracy in predict the native language of text write by author from different l background . this can be compare to a baseline of for choose randomly . this identification of lspecific feature ha been use to study language transfer effect in secondlanguage acquisition . this be useful for develop pedagogical material teaching methods lspecific instruction and generating learner feedback that is tailor to their native language . nli method can also be apply in forensic linguistics a a method of perform authorship profile in order to infer the attribute of an author include their linguistic background . this be particularly useful in situation where a text e . an anonymous letter be the key piece of evidence in an investigation and clue about the native language of a writer can help investigator in identify the source . this ha already attract interest and fund from intelligence agency . natural language processing method are use to extract and identify language usage pattern common to speaker of an lgroup . this is do use language learner data usually from a learner corpus . next machine learning is apply to train classifier like support vector machine for predict the l of unseen text . a range of ensemble based system have also been apply to the task and show to improve performance over single classifier system . various linguistic feature type have been apply for this task . these include syntactic feature such a constituent par grammatical dependency and partofspeech tag . surface level lexical feature such a character word and lemma ngrams have also been find to be quite useful for this task . however it seem that character ngrams be the single best feature for the task . the building educational application bea workshop at naacl host the inaugural nli share task . the competition result in entry from team across the globe of which also publish a paper describe their system and approach .
