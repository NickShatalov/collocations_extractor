statistical relational learning srl be a subdiscipline of artificial intelligence and machine learn that is concern with domain model that exhibit both uncertainty which can be deal with use statistical method and complex relational structure . note that srl be sometimes call relational machine learn rml in the literature . typically the knowledge representation formalism develop in srl use a subset of firstorder logic to describe relational property of a domain in a general manner universal quantification and draw upon probabilistic graphical model such a bayesian network or markov network to model the uncertainty some also build upon the method of inductive logic programming . significant contribution to the field have been make since the late s . as be evident from the characterization above the field is not strictly limit to learn aspect it is equally concern with reason specifically probabilistic inference and knowledge representation . therefore alternative term that reflect the main focus of the field include statistical relational learning and reason emphasize the importance of reason and firstorder probabilistic language emphasize the key property of the language with which model are represent . a number of canonical task are associate with statistical relational learn the most common one be . one of the fundamental design goal of the representation formalism develop in srl be to abstract away from concrete entity and to represent instead general principle that are intend to be universally applicable . since there be countless way in which such principle can be represent many representation formalism have be propose in recent year . in the follow some of the more common one are list in alphabetical order .
