deep reinforcement learn drl be a machine learn method that extend reinforcement learn approach to learn of the entire process from sensor to motor endtoend use deep learn technique . therefore it is often call endtoend reinforcement learn from the point of the aim . the traditional reinforcement learn aim to solve problem of how agent can learn to take the best action on the environment to get the maximum cumulative reward over time . a major part of this process be carefully engineer feature representation . the recent advance of deep learn for learn feature representation have pave the way for endtoend reinforcement learn . some of the main algorithm include .
