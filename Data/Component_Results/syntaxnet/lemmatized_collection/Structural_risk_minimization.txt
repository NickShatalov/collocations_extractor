structural risk minimization srm be an inductive principle of use in machine learn . commonly in machine learn a generalized model must be select from a finite data set with the consequent problem of overfitting the model become too strongly tailor to the particularity of the training set and generalize poorly to new data . the srm principle address this problem by balance the model complexity against it success at fit the training data . the srm principle wa first set out in a paper by vladimir vapnik and alexey chervonenkis and use the vc dimension .
