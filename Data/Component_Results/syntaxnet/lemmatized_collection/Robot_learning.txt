a committee machine be a type of artificial neural network use a divide and conquer strategy in which the response of multiple neural network expert are combine into a single response . the combined response of the committee machine is suppose to be superior to those of it constituent expert . compare with ensemble of classifier . in this class of committee machine the response of several predictor expert are combine by mean of a mechanism that doe not involve the input signal hence the designation static . this category include the follow methodsin ensemble averaging output of different predictor are linearly combine to produce an overall output . in boost a weak algorithm is convert into one that achieve arbitrarily high accuracy . in this second class of committee machine the input signal is directly involve in actuate the mechanism that integrate the output of the individual expert into an overall output hence the designation dynamic . there be two kind of dynamic structuresin mixture of expert the individual response of the expert are nonlinearly combine by mean of a single gating network . in hierarchical mixture of expert the individual response of the individual expert are nonlinearly combine by mean of several gating network arrange in a hierarchical fashion .
