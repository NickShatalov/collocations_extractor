the inductive bias also know a learn bias of a learning algorithm be the set of assumption that the learner use to predict output give input that it ha not encounter . in machine learn one aim to construct algorithm that be able to learn to predict a certain target output . to achieve this the learning algorithm is present some training example that demonstrate the intended relation of input and output value . then the learner is suppose to approximate the correct output even for example that have not been show during training . without any additional assumption this problem cannot be solve exactly since unseen situation might have an arbitrary output value . the kind of necessary assumption about the nature of the target function are subsume in the phrase inductive bias . a classical example of an inductive bias be occam razor assume that the simple consistent hypothesis about the target function be actually the best . here consistent mean that the hypothesis of the learner yield correct output for all of the example that have be give to the algorithm . approach to a more formal definition of inductive bias are base on mathematical logic . here the inductive bias be a logical formula that together with the training data logically entail the hypothesis generate by the learner . unfortunately this strict formalism fails in many practical case where the inductive bias can only be give a a rough description e . in the case of artificial neural network or not at all . the follow be a list of common inductive bias in machine learn algorithm . although most learn algorithm have a static bias some algorithm are design to shift their bias a they acquire more data . this doe not avoid bias since the bias shifting process itself must have a bias .
