machine learning control mlc be a subfield of machine learn intelligent control and control theorywhich solves optimal control problem with method of machine learn . key application be complex nonlinear systemsfor which linear control theory method be not applicable . four type of problem be commonly encountered . mlc comprise for instance neural network control genetic algorithm based control genetic programming controlreinforcement learn control and have methodolical overlap with other datadriven controllike artificial intelligence and robot control . mlc ha be successfully appliedto many nonlinear control problemsexploring unknown and often unexpected actuation mechanism . example application includeas for all general nonlinear methodsmlc come with no guaranteed convergence optimality or robustness for a range of operate condition .
