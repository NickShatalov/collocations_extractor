the bradleyterry model be a probability model that can predict the outcome of a comparison . give a pair of individual and drawn from some population it estimate the probability that the pairwise comparison turn out true a . where be a positive realvalued score assign to individual . the comparison can be read a is prefer to rank high than or beat depend on the application . for example may represent the skill of a team in a sport tournament estimate from the number of time have won a match . formula then represents the probability that will win a match against . another example use to explain the model purpose be that of score product in a certain category by quality . while it hard for a person to draft a direct ranking of many brand of wine it may be feasible to compare a sample of pair of wine and say for each pair which one be good . the bradleyterry model can then be use to derive a full ranking . the model is name after r . bradley and m . terry who present it in although it had already been study by zermelo in the s . realworld application of the model include estimation of the influence of statistical journal or ranking document by relevance in machinelearned search engine . in the latter application formula may reflect that document be more relevant to the user query than document so it should be display early in the result list . the individual then express the relevance of the document and can be estimate from the frequency with which user click particular hit when presented with a result list . the bradleyterry model can be parametrized in various way . one way to do so be to pick a single parameter per observation lead to a model of parameter . another variant in fact the version consider by bradley and terry us exponential score function formula so that . or use the logit and disallow tie . reduce the model to logistic regression on pair of individual . the follow algorithm compute the parameter of the basic version of the model from a sample of observation . formally it compute a maximum likelihood estimate i . it maximize the likelihood of the observed data . the algorithm date back to the work of zermelo . the observation require be the outcome of previous comparison for example pair where beat . summarize these outcome a the number of time ha beat we obtain the loglikelihood of the parameter vector a . denote the number of comparison won by a and the number of comparison make between and as . start from an arbitrary vector the algorithm iteratively perform the update . for all . after compute all of the new parameter they should be renormalize . this estimation procedure improve the loglikelihood in every iteration and eventually converge to a unique maximum .
