in the field of machine learn the theory of computation and random matrix theory a probability distribution over vector is say to be in isotropic position if it covariance matrix be equal to the identity matrix . let formula be a distribution over vector in the vector space formula . then formula be in isotropic position if for vector formula sample from the distributiona set of vector is say to be in isotropic position if the uniform distribution over that set be in isotropic position . in particular every orthonormal set of vector be isotropic . a a relate definition a convex body formula in formula is call isotropic if it have volume formula center of mass at the origin and there be a constant formula such thatfor all vector formula in formula here formula stand for the standard euclidean norm .
