opennn open neural network library be a software library write in the c programming language which implement neural network a main area of deep learn research . the library be open source license under the gnu less general public license . the software implement any number of layer of nonlinear process unit for supervised learn . this deep architecture allow the design of neural network with universal approximation property . additionally it allow multiprocessing programming by mean of openmp in order to increase computer performance . opennn contain data mine algorithm a a bundle of function . these can be embed in other software tool use an application programming interface for the integration of the predictive analytics task . in this regard a graphical user interface be missing but some function can be support by specific visualization tool . the development start in at the international center for numerical method in engineer cimne within the research project fund by the european union call ramflood risk assessment and management of flood . then it continue a part of similar project . at present opennn is being develop by the startup company artelnics . opennn be a general purpose artificial intelligence software package . it use machine learning technique for solving data mine and predictive analytics task in different field . for instance the library ha been apply in the engineering energy or chemistry sector .
