in computer science computational learning theory or just learn theory be a subfield of artificial intelligence devote to study the design and analysis of machine learn algorithm . theoretical result in machine learn mainly deal with a type of inductive learning call supervise learn . in supervisedlearning an algorithm is give sample that are label in some useful way . for example the sample might be description ofmushrooms and the label could be whether or not the mushroom be edible . the algorithm take these previously labeled sample anduses them to induce a classifier . this classifier be a function that assign label to sample include sample that have never beenpreviously see by the algorithm . the goal of the supervised learning algorithm be to optimize some measure of performance such asminimizing the number of mistake make on new sample . in addition to performance bound computational learning theory study the time complexity and feasibility of learn . incomputational learning theory a computation be consider feasible if it can be do in polynomial time . there be two kind of timecomplexity resultsnegative result often rely on commonly believe but yet unproven assumption such asthere be several different approach to computational learning theory . these difference are base on make assumption about theinference principle use to generalize from limited data . this include different definition of probability see frequency probability bayesian probability and different assumption on the generation of sample . the different approach include computational learning theory ha lead to several practical algorithm . for example pac theory inspired boosting vc theory lead to support vector machine and bayesian inference lead to belief network by judea pearl . a description of some of these publication is give at important publication in machine learn .
