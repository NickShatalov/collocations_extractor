the follow outline is provide a an overview of and topical guide to machine learn . machine learning subfield of computer science more particularly soft compute that evolve from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence . in arthur samuel define machine learn a a field of study that give computer the ability to learn without be explicitly programmed . machine learning explore the study and construction of algorithm that can learn from and make prediction on data . such algorithm operate by build a model from an example training set of input observation in order to make datadriven prediction or decision expressed a output rather than follow strictly static program instruction . subfields of machine learn . crossdisciplinary field involving machine learn . application of machine learn . machine learn hardware . machine learn tool list . machine learn framework . proprietary machine learn framework . open source machine learn framework . machine learn library . machine learn algorithm . machine learn method list . dimensionality reduction . ensemble learn . meta learn . reinforcement learn . supervise learn . bayesian statistic . decision tree algorithm . linear classifier . unsupervised learn . artificial neural network . association rule learn . hierarchical clustering . cluster analysis . anomaly detection . semisupervised learn . deep learn . machine learn research . history of machine learn . machine learn project . machine learn organization . book about machine learn .
