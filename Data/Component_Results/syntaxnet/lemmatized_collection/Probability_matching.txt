probability matching be a decision strategy in which prediction of class membership be proportional to the class base rate . thus if in the training set positive example are observe of the time and negative example are observe of the time then the observer use a probabilitymatching strategy will predict for unlabeled example a class label of positive on of instance and a class label of negative on of instance . the optimal bayesian decision strategy to maximize the number of correct prediction see in such a case be to always predict positive i . predict the majority category in the absence of other information which have chance of win rather than match which have of win where p be the probability of positive realization the result of matching would be formula here formula . the probabilitymatching strategy be of psychological interest because it is frequently employ by human subject in decision and classification study where it may be relate to thompson sampling .
