evolutionary programming be one of the four major evolutionary algorithm paradigm . it be similar to genetic programming but the structure of the program to be optimize is fix while it numerical parameter are allow to evolve . it wa first use by lawrence j . fogel in the u in in order to use simulated evolution a a learning process aim to generate artificial intelligence . fogel use finitestate machine a predictor and evolve them . currently evolutionary programming be a wide evolutionary computing dialect with no fixed structure or representation in contrast with some of the other dialect . it is become harder to distinguish from evolutionary strategy . it main variation operator be mutation member of the population are view a part of a specific specie rather than member of the same specie therefore each parent generates an offspring use a survivor selection .
