logic learn machine llm be a machine learn method base on the generation of intelligible rule . llm be an efficient implementation of the switch neural network snn paradigm develop by marco muselli senior researcher at the italian national research council cnrieiit in genoa . logic learn machine is implement in the rulex suite . llm ha been employ in different field include orthopaedic patient classification dna microarray analysis and clinical decision support system . the switch neural network approach wa develop in the s to overcome the drawback of the most commonly use machine learn method . in particular black box method such a multilayer perceptron and support vector machine have good accuracy but could not provide deep insight into the studied phenomenon . on the other hand decision tree be able to describe the phenomenon but often lack accuracy . switch neural network make use of boolean algebra to build set of intelligible rule able to obtain very good performance . in an efficient version of switch neural network wa develop and implement in the rulex suite with the name logic learn machine . also a llm version devote to regression problem be developed . like other machine learn method llm use data to build a model able to perform a good forecast about future behavior . llm start from a table include a target variable output and some input and generate a set of rule that return the output value formula correspond to a give configuration of input . a rule is write in the formwhere consequence contain the output value whereas premise include one or more condition on the input . accord to the input type condition can have different formsa possible rule be therefore in the formaccording to the output type different version of logic learn machine have be developed .
