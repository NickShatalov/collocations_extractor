in endtoend reinforcement learn the endtoend process in other word the entire process from sensor to motor in a robot or agent involve a single layered or recurrent neural network without modularization . the network is train by reinforcement learn rl . the approach ha been propose for a long time but wa reenergized by the successful result in learn to play atari video game and alphago by google deepmind . it employ supervise learn without require sample label usually manually data . rl traditionally require explicit design of state space and action space while the map from state space to action space be learned . therefore rl ha been limit to learn only for action and human designer have to design how to construct state space from sensor signal and to give how the motion command are generate for each action before learn . neural network have be often use in rl to provide nonlinear function approximation to avoid the curse of dimensionality . recurrent neural network have been also employ mainly to avoid perceptual aliasing or partially observable markov decision process pomdp . endtoend rl extends rl from learn only for action to learn the entire process from sensor to motor include higherlevel function that be difficult to develop independently from other function . higherlevel function do not connect directly with either sensor or motor and so even give their input and output be difficult . the approach originate in tdgammon . in backgammon the evaluation of the game situation during selfplay wa learn through tdformula using a layer neural network . four input were use for the number of piece of a give color at a given location on the board total input signal . with zero knowledge built in the network learn to play the game at an intermediate level . shibata begin work with this framework in . they employ qlearning and actorcritic for continuous motion task and use a recurrent neural network for memoryrequired task . they apply this framework to some real robot task . they demonstrate learn of various function . begin around google deepmind show impressive learning result in video game and game of go alphago . they use a deep convolutional neural network that show superior result in image recognition . they use frame of almost raw rgb pixel x a input . the network wa train base on rl with the reward represent the sign of the change in the game score . all game were learn use the same network architecture and qlearning with minimal prior knowledge and outperformed competing method on almost all the game and perform at a level that be comparable or superior to a professional human game tester . it be sometimes called deepq network dqn . in alphago deep neural network are train not only by reinforcement learn but also by supervise learn and monte carlo tree search . shibatas group show that various function emerge in this framework including communication were establish in this framework . mode include .
