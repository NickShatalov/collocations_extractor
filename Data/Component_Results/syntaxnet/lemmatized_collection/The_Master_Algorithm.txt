the master algorithm how the quest for the ultimate learning machine will remake our world be a book by pedro domingo release in . domingo write the book in order to generate interest from people outside the field . the book outline five tribe of machine learn inductive reasoning connectionism evolutionary computation bayes theorem and analogical modelling . the author explains these tribe to the reader by refer to more understandable process of logic connection make in the brain natural selection probability and similarity judgement . throughout the book it is suggest that each different tribe have the potential to contribute to a unifying master algorithm . towards the end of the book the author picture a master algorithm in the near future where machine learning algorithm asymptotically grow to a perfect understanding of how the world and people in it work . although the algorithm doesnt yet exist he briefly review his own invention of the markov logic network . in bill gate recommend the book alongside nick bostroms superintelligence a one of two book everyone should read to understand ai . in the book wa note to be on chinese president xi jinpings bookshelf . a computer science educator state in time high education that the example be clear and accessible . in contrast the economist agreed domingo do a good job but complain that he constantly invent metaphor that grate or confuse . kirkus review praise the book stating reader unfamiliar with logic and computer theory will have a difficult time but those who persist will discover fascinate insight . a new scientist review call it compel but rather unquestioning .
