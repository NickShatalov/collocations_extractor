learn to rank or machinelearned ranking mlr be the application of machine learning typically supervise semisupervised or reinforcement learn in the construction of rank model for information retrieval system . train data consists of list of item with some partial order specify between item in each list . this order is typically induce by give a numerical or ordinal score or a binary judgment e . relevant or not relevant for each item . the ranking model purpose be to rank i . produce a permutation of item in new unseen list in a way which be similar to rank in the training data in some sense . rank be a central part of many information retrieval problem such a document retrieval collaborative filtering sentiment analysis and online advertising . a possible architecture of a machinelearned search engine is show in the figure to the right . train data consists of query and document match them together with relevance degree of each match . it may be prepare manually by human assessor or raters a google call them . who check result for some query and determine relevance of each result . it be not feasible to check the relevance of all document and so typically a technique called pooling is use only the top few document retrieve by some exist ranking model are check . alternatively train data may be derive automatically by analyze clickthrough log i . search result which get click from user query chain or such search engines feature a google searchwiki . train data is use by a learning algorithm to produce a ranking model which compute the relevance of document for actual query . typically user expect a search query to complete in a short time such a a few hundred millisecond for web search which make it impossible to evaluate a complex rank model on each document in the corpus and so a twophase scheme is use . first a small number of potentially relevant document are identify use simple retrieval model which permit fast query evaluation such a the vector space model boolean model weight and or bm . this phase be call topformula document retrieval and many heuristic were propose in the literature to accelerate it such a use a document static quality score and tiered index . in the second phase a more accurate but computationally expensive machinelearned model is use to rerank these document . learn to rank algorithm have been apply in areas other than information retrieval . for the convenience of mlr algorithm querydocument pair are usually represent by numerical vector which are call feature vector . such an approach be sometimes called bag of feature and be analogous to the bag of word model and vector space model use in information retrieval for representation of document . component of such vector are call feature factor or rank signal . they may be divide into three group feature from document retrieval be shown a example . some example of feature which were use in the wellknown letor dataset . select and design good feature be an important area in machine learn which is call feature engineer . there be several measure metric which are commonly use to judge how well an algorithm is do on train data and to compare the performance of different mlr algorithm . often a learningtorank problem is reformulate a an optimization problem with respect to one of these metric . example of rank quality measure . dcg and it normalize variant ndcg are usually prefer in academic research when multiple level of relevance are use . other metric such a map mrr and precision are define only for binary judgment . recently there have been propose several new evaluation metric which claim to model user satisfaction with search result good than the dcg metric . both of these metric are base on the assumption that the user be more likely to stop look at search result after examine a more relevant document than after a less relevant document . tieyan liu of microsoft research asia ha analyze existing algorithm for learn to rank problem in his paper learn to rank for information retrieval . he categorize them into three group by their input representation and loss function the pointwise pairwise and listwise approach . in practice listwise approach often outperform pairwise approach and pointwise approach . this statement wa far support by a large scale experiment on the performance of different learningtorank method on a large collection of benchmark data set . in this case it is assume that each querydocument pair in the training data have a numerical or ordinal score . then the learningtorank problem can be approximate by a regression problem give a single querydocument pair predict its score . a number of exist supervise machine learn algorithm can be readily use for this purpose . ordinal regression and classification algorithm can also be use in pointwise approach when they are use to predict the score of a single querydocument pair and it take a small finite number of value . in this case the learningtorank problem is approximate by a classification problem learn a binary classifier that can tell which document be good in a give pair of document . the goal be to minimize the average number of inversion in ranking . these algorithm try to directly optimize the value of one of the above evaluation measure average over all query in the training data . this be difficult because most evaluation measure be not continuous function with respect to rank model parameter and so continuous approximation or bound on evaluation measure have to be use . a partial list of publish learningtorank algorithm is show below with year of first publication of each method . note a most supervise learn algorithm can be apply to pointwise case only those method which are specifically design with rank in mind are show above . norbert fuhr introduce the general idea of mlr in describe learn approach in information retrieval a a generalization of parameter estimation a specific variant of this approach use polynomial regression had be publish by him three year earlier . bill cooper propose logistic regression for the same purpose in and use it with his berkeley research group to train a successful ranking function for trec . man et al . suggest that these early work achieve limited result in their time due to little available training data and poor machine learn technique . several conference such a nip sigir and icml have workshop devote to the learningtorank problem since mids decade . commercial web search engines began using machine learn ranking system since the s decade . one of the first search engines to start use it be altavista later it technology wa acquire by overture and then yahoo which launch a gradient boostingtrained ranking function in april . bings search is say to be power by ranknet algorithm which wa invent at microsoft research in . in november a russian search engine yandex announce that it had significantly increase it search quality due to deployment of a new proprietary matrixnet algorithm a variant of gradient boost method which use oblivious decision tree . recently they have also sponsor a machinelearned ranking competition internet mathematics base on their own search engines production data . yahoo ha announce a similar competition in . a of google peter norvig deny that their search engine exclusively rely on machinelearned ranking . cuils ceo tom costello suggest that they prefer handbuilt model because they can outperform machinelearned model when measure against metric like clickthrough rate or time on land page which is because machinelearned model learn what people say they like not what people actually like . in january the technology wa include in the open source search engine apache solr thus making machine learn search rank widely accessible also for enterprise search .
