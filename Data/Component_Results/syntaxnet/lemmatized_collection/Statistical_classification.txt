in machine learning and statistic classification be the problem of identify to which of a set of category subpopulation a new observation belongs on the basis of a training set of data containing observation or instance whose category membership be known . example are assign a give email to the spam or nonspam class and assign a diagnosis to a given patient base on observe characteristic of the patient gender blood pressure presence or absence of certain symptom etc . classification be an example of pattern recognition . in the terminology of machine learning classification is consider an instance of supervise learn i . learn where a train set of correctly identified observation be available . the correspond unsupervised procedure is know a cluster and involves group data into category base on some measure of inherent similarity or distance . often the individual observation are analyze into a set of quantifiable property know variously a explanatory variable or feature . these property may variously be categorical e . a b ab or o for blood type ordinal e . large medium or small integervalued e . the number of occurrence of a particular word in an email or realvalued e . a measurement of blood pressure . other classifier work by comparing observation to previous observation by mean of a similarity or distance function . an algorithm that implement classification especially in a concrete implementation is know a a classifier . the term classifier sometimes also refer to the mathematical function implement by a classification algorithm that map input data to a category . terminology across field be quite varied . in statistic where classification is often do with logistic regression or a similar procedure the property of observation are term explanatory variable or independent variable regressors etc . and the category to be predict are know a outcome which are consider to be possible value of the dependent variable . in machine learn the observation are often know a instance the explanatory variable are term feature group into a feature vector and the possible category to be predict be class . other field may use different terminology e . in community ecology the term classification normally refer to cluster analysis i . a type of unsupervised learn rather than the supervised learning describe in this article . classification and clustering be example of the more general problem of pattern recognition which be the assignment of some sort of output value to a give input value . other example be regression which assign a realvalued output to each input sequence label which assign a class to each member of a sequence of value for example part of speech tag which assign a part of speech to each word in an input sentence parsing which assign a parse tree to an input sentence describe the syntactic structure of the sentence etc . a common subclass of classification be probabilistic classification . algorithm of this nature use statistical inference to find the best class for a given instance . unlike other algorithm which simply output a best class probabilistic algorithm output a probability of the instance be a member of each of the possible class . the best class be normally then select a the one with the highest probability . however such an algorithm have numerous advantage over nonprobabilistic classifier . early work on statistical classification wa undertake by fisher in the context of twogroup problem lead to fisher linear discriminant function a the rule for assign a group to a new observation . this early work assume that datavalues within each of the two group have a multivariate normal distribution . the extension of this same context to more than twogroups ha also been consider with a restriction impose that the classification rule should be linear . later work for the multivariate normal distribution allow the classifier to be nonlinear several classification rule can be derive base on slight different adjustment of the mahalanobis distance with a new observation being assign to the group whose centre have the lowest adjust distance from the observation . unlike frequentist procedure bayesian classification procedure provide a natural way of take into account any available information about the relative size of the subpopulation associate with the different group within the overall population . bayesian procedure tend to be computationally expensive and in the day before markov chain monte carlo computation were develop approximation for bayesian clustering rule were devise . some bayesian procedure involve the calculation of group membership probability these can be view a provide a more and more informative outcome of a data analysis than a simple attribution of a single grouplabel to each new observation . classification can be thought of a two separate problem binary classification and multiclass classification . in binary classification a good understood task only two class are involve whereas multiclass classification involves assign an object to one of several class . since many classification method have been develop specifically for binary classification multiclass classification often require the combine use of multiple binary classifier . most algorithm describe an individual instance whose category be to be predict use a feature vector of individual measurable property of the instance . each property is term a feature also know in statistic a an explanatory variable or independent variable although feature may or may not be statistically independent . feature may variously be binary e . on or off categorical e . a b ab or o for blood type ordinal e . large medium or small integervalued e . the number of occurrence of a particular word in an email or realvalued e . a measurement of blood pressure . if the instance be an image the feature value might correspond to the pixel of an image if the instance be a piece of text the feature value might be occurrence frequency of different word . some algorithm work only in term of discrete data and require that realvalued or integervalued data be discretized into group e . less than between and or great than . a large number of algorithm for classification can be phrase in term of a linear function that assign a score to each possible category k by combine the feature vector of an instance with a vector of weight use a dot product . the predicted category be the one with the high score . this type of score function is know a a linear predictor function and have the follow general form . where x be the feature vector for instance i be the vector of weight correspond to category k and scorex k be the score associated with assign instance i to category k . in discrete choice theory where instance represent people and category represent choice the score is consider the utility associate with person i choosing category k . algorithm with this basic setup be known a linear classifier . what distinguish them be the procedure for determine train the optimal weightscoefficients and the way that the score be interpreted . example of such algorithm be . example of classification algorithm include . classifier performance depend greatly on the characteristic of the data to be classify . there be no single classifier that work best on all give problem a phenomenon that may be explain by the nofreelunch theorem . various empirical test have been perform to compare classifier performance and to find the characteristic of data that determine classifier performance . determine a suitable classifier for a given problem be however still more an art than a science . the measure precision and recall be popular metric used to evaluate the quality of a classification system . more recently receiver operate characteristic roc curve have been use to evaluate the tradeoff between true and falsepositive rate of classification algorithm . a a performance metric the uncertainty coefficient have the advantage over simple accuracy in that it is not affect by the relative size of the different class . further it will not penalize an algorithm for simply rearrange the class . classification have many application . in some of these it is employ a a data mine procedure while in others more detail statistical modeling be undertaken .
