hierarchical deep learn be the machine learning task with the hierarchical label data a classification or categorization . since the example give to the learner be hierarchical label the evaluation is base on the accuracy or fmeasure base on multi level of the model hierarchy . this model have been use for text classification a in hierarchical deep learn employ stack of deep learn architecture to provide specialized understand at each level of the data hierarchy . approach a part of hdl include . the primary contribution of this technique be hierarchical classification of document . a traditional multiclass classification technique can work well for a limited number class but performance drop with increase number of category or class a be present in hierarchically organized document . many technique work on hierarchical attention for text classification or multimodel deep learn for classification task . hence they provide extension over current method for document classification that only consider the multiclass problem . the method describe a hdltex can improve in multiple way . additional training and test with other hierarchically structured document data set will continue to identify architecture that work best for these problem . also it be possible to extend the hierarchy to more than two level to capture more of the complexity in the hierarchical classification . for example if keywords are treat a order then the hierarchy continues down multiple level . hdltex can also be apply to unlabeled unsupervised document such a those found in news or other medium outlet . in hierarchical deep learn model this problem is solve by create architecture that specialize deep learn approach for their level of the document hierarchy . the structure of hierarchical deep learn for text hdltex architecture for each deep learn model be a follows . hierarchical deep learn can be use for sentiment analysis in any language for social network of document .
