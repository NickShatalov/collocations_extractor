eclipse deeplearningj be a deep learn programming library write for java and the java virtual machine jvm and a compute framework with wide support for deep learn algorithm . deeplearningj include implementation of the restrict boltzmann machine deep belief net deep autoencoder stack denoising autoencoder and recursive neural tensor network wordvec docvec and glove . these algorithm all include distribute parallel versions that integrate with apache hadoop and spark . deeplearningj be opensource software release under apache license . developed mainly by a machine learn group headquarter in san francisco and tokyo and lead by adam gibson . it is support commercially by the startup skymind which bundle dlj tensorflow kera and other deep learn library in an enterprise distribution call the skymind intelligence layer . deeplearningj wa contribute to the eclipse foundation in october . deeplearningj rely on the widely use programming language java though it be compatible with clojure and include a scala application programming interface api . it is power by it own opensource numerical computing library ndj and work with both central process unit cpus and graphic process unit gpus . deeplearningj ha been use in several commercial and academic application . the code is host on github . a support forum is maintain on gitter . the framework be composable meaning shallow neural net such a restrict boltzmann machine convolutional net autoencoders and recurrent net can be add to one another to create deep net of vary type . it also have extensive visualization tool and a computation graph . train with deeplearningj occurs in a cluster . neural net are train in parallel via iterative reduce which work on hadoopyarn and on spark . deeplearningj also integrate with cuda kernel to conduct pure gpu operation and work with distributed gpus . deeplearningj include an ndimensional array class use ndj that allow scientific computing in java and scala similar to the function that numpy provide to python . it effectively base on a library for linear algebra and matrix manipulation in a production environment . datavec vectorizes various file format and data type use an inputoutput format system similar to hadoops use of mapreduce that be it turn various data type into column of scalar termed vector . datavec is design to vectorize csvs image sound text video and time series . deeplearningj include a vector space modeling and topic modeling toolkit implement in java and integrate with parallel gpus for performance . it is design to handle large text set . deeplearningj include implementation of term frequencyinverse document frequency tfidf deep learn and mikolovs wordvec algorithm docvec and glove reimplemented and optimize in java . it rely on tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding tsne for wordcloud visualization . realworld use case for deeplearningj include network intrusion detection and cybersecurity fraud detection for the financial sector anomaly detection in industry such a manufacture recommender system in ecommerce and advertise and image recognition . deeplearningj ha integrate with other machinelearning platform such a rapidminer prediction . io and weka . deeplearningj serf machinelearning model for inference in production use the free developer edition of skil the skymind intelligence layer . a model server serve the parametric machinelearning model that make decision about data . it is use for the inference stage of a machinelearning workflow after data pipeline and model training . a model server be the tool that allow data science research to be deploy in a realworld production environment . what a web server be to the internet a model server be to ai . where a web server receive an http request and return data about a web site a model server receive data and return a decision or prediction about that data e . send an image a model server might return a label for that image identifying face or animal in photograph . the skil model server be able to import model from python framework such a tensorflow kera theano and cntk overcome a major barrier in deploy deep learn model . deeplearningj be a fast a caffe for nontrivial image recognition task use multiple gpus . for programmer unfamiliar with hpc on the jvm there be several parameter that must be adjust to optimize neural network train time . these include set the heap space the garbage collection algorithm employ offheap memory and presaving data pickle for faster etl . together these optimization can lead to a x acceleration in performance with deeplearningj . deeplearningj can be use via multiple api language include java scala python and clojure . it scala api is call scalnet . kera serf a it python api . and it clojure wrapper is know a dlclj . the core language perform the largescale mathematical operation necessary for deep learn be c c and cuda c . tensorflow kera and deeplearningj work together . deeplearningj can import model from tensorflow and other python framework if they have been create with kera .
