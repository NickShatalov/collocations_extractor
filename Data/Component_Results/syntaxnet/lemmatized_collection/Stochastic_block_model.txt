the stochastic block model be a generative model for random graph . this model tend to produce graph containing community subsets characterize by being connect with one another with particular edge density . for example edge may be more common within community than between community . the stochastic block model be important in statistic machine learn and network science where it serve a a useful benchmark for the task of recover community structure in graph data . the stochastic block model take the follow parameter . the edge set is then sample at random a follow any two vertex formula and formula are connect by an edge with probability formula . if the probability matrix be a constant in the sense that formula for all formula then the result be the erdsrnyi model formula . this case be degeneratethe partition into community become irrelevantbut it illustrate a close relationship to the erdsrnyi model . the plant partition model be the special case that the value of the probability matrix formula be a constant formula on the diagonal and another constant formula off the diagonal . thus two vertex within the same community share an edge with probability formula while two vertex in different community share an edge with probability formula . sometimes it be this restricted model that is call the stochastic block model . the case where formula is call an assortative model while the case formula is call dissortative . return to the general stochastic block model a model is call strongly assortative if formula whenever formula all diagonal entry dominate all offdiagonal entry . a model is call weakly assortative if formula whenever formula each diagonal entry be only required to dominate the rest of it own row and column . dissortative form of this terminology exist by reverse all inequality . algorithmic recovery be often easy against block model with assortative or dissortative condition of this form . much of the literature on algorithmic community detection address three statistical task detection partial recovery and exact recovery . the goal of detection algorithm be simply to determine given a sample graph whether the graph have latent community structure . more precisely a graph might be generate with some known prior probability from a known stochastic block model and otherwise from a similar erdosrenyi model . the algorithmic task be to correctly identify which of these two underlie model generate the graph . in partial recovery the goal be to approximately determine the latent partition into community in the sense of find a partition that be correlated with the true partition significantly good than a random guess . in exact recovery the goal be to recover the latent partition into community exactly . the community size and probability matrix may be know or unknown . stochastic block model exhibit a sharp threshold effect reminiscent of percolation threshold . suppose that we allow the size formula of the graph to grow keep the community size in fixed proportion . if the probability matrix remains fix task such a partial and exact recovery become feasible for all nondegenerate parameter setting . however if we scale down the probability matrix at a suitable rate a formula increase we observe a sharp phase transition for certain setting of the parameter it will become possible to achieve recovery with probability tending to whereas on the opposite side of the parameter threshold the probability of recovery tends to no matter what algorithm is use . for partial recovery the appropriate scaling be to take formula for fix formula resulting in graph of constant average degree . in the case of two equalsized community in the assortative planted partition model with probability matrix . formula . partial recovery be feasible with probability formula whenever formula whereas any estimator fail partial recovery with probability formula whenever formula . for exact recovery the appropriate scaling be to take formula resulting in graph of logarithmic average degree . here a similar threshold exist for the assortative plant partition model with formula equalsized community the threshold lie at formula . in fact the exact recovery threshold is know for the fully general stochastic block model . in principle exact recovery can be solve in it feasible range use maximum likelihood but this amount to solve a constrained or regularize cut problem such a minimum bisection that be typically npcomplete . hence no known efficient algorithm will correctly compute the maximumlikelihood estimate in the bad case . however a wide variety of algorithm perform well in the average case and many highprobability performance guarantee have be prove for algorithm in both the partial and exact recovery setting . successful algorithm include spectral clustering of the vertex semidefinite programming and form of belief propagation among others . several variant of the model exist . one minor tweak allocate vertex to community randomly accord to a categorical distribution rather than in a fix partition . more significant variant include the censor block model and the mixedmembership block model .
