parity learn be a problem in machine learn . an algorithm that solve this problem must find a function give some sample xx and the assurance that compute the parity of bit at some fixed location . the sample are generate use some distribution over the input . the problem be easy to solve using gaussian elimination provide that a sufficient number of sample from a distribution which be not too skew are provide to the algorithm . in this version the sample may contain some error . instead of sample xx the algorithm is provide with xy where yx with some small probability . the noisy version of the parity learn problem is conjecture to be hard .
