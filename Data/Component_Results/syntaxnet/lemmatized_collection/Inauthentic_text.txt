product of expert poe be a machine learn technique . it model a probability distribution by combine the output from several simple distribution . it wa propose by geoff hinton along with an algorithm for train the parameter of such a system . the core idea be to combine several probability distribution experts by multiply their density functionsmaking the poe classification similar to an and operation . this allow each expert to make decision on the basis of a few dimension without have to cover the full dimensionality of a problem . this be related to but quite different from a mixture model where several probability distribution are combine via an or operation which be a weight sum of their density function .
