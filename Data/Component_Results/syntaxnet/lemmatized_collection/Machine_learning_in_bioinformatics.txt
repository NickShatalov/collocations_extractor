machine learn a subfield of computer science involve the development of algorithm that learn how to make prediction base on data have a number of emerge application in the field of bioinformatics . bioinformatics deal with computational and mathematical approach for understanding and process biological data . prior to the emergence of machine learn algorithm bioinformatics algorithm have to be explicitly program by hand which for problem such a protein structure prediction prove extremely difficult . machine learning technique such a deep learn enable the algorithm to make use of automatic feature learn which mean that base on the dataset alone the algorithm can learn how to combine multiple feature of the input data into a more abstract set of feature from which to conduct far learn . this multilayered approach to learning pattern in the input data allow such system to make quite complex prediction when train on large datasets . in recent year the size and number of available biological datasets have skyrocket enabling bioinformatics researcher to make use of these machine learn system . machine learning ha been apply to six main subfields of bioinformatics genomics proteomics microarrays system biology evolution and text mine . genomics involve the study of the genome the complete dna sequence of organism . while genomic sequence data ha historically be sparse due to the technical difficulty in sequence a piece of dna the number of available sequence is grow exponentially . however while raw data is become increasingly available and accessible the biological interpretation of this data is occur at a much slower pace . therefore there be an increasing need for the development of machine learn system that can automatically determine the location of proteinencoding gene within a give dna sequence . this be a problem in computational biology know a gene prediction . gene prediction is commonly perform through a combination of what are know a extrinsic and intrinsic search . for the extrinsic search the input dna sequence is run through a large database of sequence whose gene have be previously discover and their location annotate . a number of the sequence gene can be identify by determine which string of base within the sequence be homologous to know gene sequence . however give the limitation in size of the database of known and annotate gene sequence not all the gene in a given input sequence can be identify through homology alone . therefore an intrinsic search is need where a gene prediction program attempt to identify the remain gene from the dna sequence alone . machine learning is also been use for the problem of multiple sequence alignment which involve aligning many dna or amino acid sequence in order to determine region of similarity that could indicate a share evolutionary history . it can also be use to detect and visualize genome rearrangement . proteins string of amino acid gain much of their function from protein folding in which they conform into a threedimensional structure . this structure is compose of a number of layer of folding include the primary structure i . the flat string of amino acids the secondary structure alpha helix and beta sheet the tertiary structure and the quartenary structure . protein secondary structure prediction be a main focus of this subfield a the further protein folding tertiary and quartenary structure are determine base on the secondary structure . solve the true structure of a protein be an incredibly expensive and timeintensive process further the need for system that can accurately predict the structure of a protein by analyze the amino acid sequence directly . prior to machine learning researcher need to conduct this prediction manually . this trend begin in when pauling and corey release their work on predict the hydrogen bond configuration of a protein from a polypeptide chain . today through the use of automatic feature learn the best machine learning technique be able to achieve an accuracy of . the current stateoftheart in secondary structure prediction us a system call deepcnf deep convolutional neural field which rely on the machine learn model of artificial neural network to achieve an accuracy of approximately when task to classify the amino acid of a protein sequence into one of three structural class helix sheet or coil . the theoretical limit for threestate protein secondary structure be . machine learning ha also been apply to proteomics problems such a protein sidechain prediction protein loop model and protein contact map prediction . microarrays a type of labonachip are use for automatically collect data about large amount of biological material . machine learn can aid in the analysis of this data and it ha been apply to expression pattern identification classification and genetic network induction . this technology be especially useful for monitor the expression of gene within a genome aid in diagnose different type of cancer base on which gene are express . one of the main problem in this field be identifying which gene are express base on the collected data . in addition due to the huge number of gene on which data is collect by the microarray there be a large amount of irrelevant data to the task of express gene identification further complicate this problem . machine learn present a potential solution to this problem a various classification method can be use to perform this identification . the most commonly use method be radial basis function network deep learn bayesian classification decision tree and random forest . system biology focus on the study of the emergent behavior from complex interaction of simple biological component in a system . such component can include molecules such a dna rna protein and metabolite . machine learning ha been use to aid in the modelling of these complex interaction in biological system in domain such a genetic network signal transduction network and metabolic pathway . probabilistic graphical model a machine learning technique for determine the structure between different variable be one of the most commonly use method for model genetic network . in addition machine learn ha been apply to system biology problem such a identify transcription factor bind site use a technique known a markov chain optimization . genetic algorithm machine learning technique which are base on the natural process of evolution have been use to model genetic network and regulatory structure . other system biology application of machine learn include the task of enzyme function prediction high throughput microarray data analysis analysis of genomewide association study to good understand marker of multiple sclerosis protein function prediction and identification of ncrsensitivity of gene in yeast . the increase in available biological publication lead to the issue of the increase in difficulty in search through and compile all the relevant available information on a give topic across all source . this task be known a knowledge extraction . this be necessary for biological data collection which can then in turn be feed into machine learn algorithm to generate new biological knowledge . machine learning can be use for this knowledge extraction task using technique such a natural language process to extract the useful information from humangenerated report in a database . text nail an alternative approach to machine learning capable of extract feature from clinical narrative note wa introduce in . this technique ha been apply to the search for novel drug target a this task require the examination of information store in biological database and journal . annotation of protein in protein database often do not reflect the complete known set of knowledge of each protein so additional information must be extract from biomedical literature . machine learning ha been apply to automatic annotation of the function of gene and protein determination of the subcellular localization of a protein analysis of dnaexpression array largescale protein interaction analysis and molecule interaction analysis . another application of text mining be the detection and visualization of distinct dna region give sufficient reference data .
