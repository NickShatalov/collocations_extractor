In the fields of machine learning, the theory of computation, and random matrix theory, a probability distribution over vectors is said to be in isotropic position if its covariance matrix is equal to the identity matrix. 

Let formula_1 be a distribution over vectors in the vector space formula_2.
Then formula_1 is in isotropic position if, for vector formula_4 sampled from the distribution,

A "set" of vectors is said to be in isotropic position if the uniform distribution over that set is in isotropic position. In particular, every orthonormal set of vectors is isotropic.

As a related definition, a convex body formula_6 in formula_2 is called isotropic if it has volume formula_8, center of mass at the origin, and there is a constant formula_9 such that

for all vectors formula_11 in formula_2; here formula_13 stands 
for the standard Euclidean norm.
