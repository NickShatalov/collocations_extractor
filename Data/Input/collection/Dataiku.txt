Dataiku is a computer software company headquartered in New York City. The company develops collaborative data science software marketed for big data.

For its first two years, the company relied on its own capital. In January 2015, Dataiku raised $3.6 million from Serena Capital and Alven Capital, two French technology venture capital funds. This was followed by $14 million raised with FirstMark Capital, a New York City-based venture capital firm in October 2016.

Dataiku opened an office in New York City in 2015 which became the company headquarters. They opened an office in London in the summer of 2016.

The software Dataiku Data Science Studio (DSS) was announced in 2014, supporting predictive modelling to build business applications. Later versions of DSS added other features.

Dataiku offers a free edition and enterprise versions with additional features, such as multi-user collaboration or real-time scoring.

In 2017, Dataiku entered the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Science Platforms as a "visionary".
