Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a machine learning method that extends reinforcement learning approach to learning of the entire process from sensors to motors (end-to-end) using deep learning techniques. Therefore it is often called end-to-end reinforcement learning from the point of the aim.

The traditional Reinforcement learning aims to solve problems of how agents can learn to take the best actions on the environment to get the maximum cumulative reward over time. A major part of this process is carefully engineering feature representations. The recent advances of deep learning for learning feature representations have paved the way for end-to-end reinforcement learning.

Some of the main algorithms include:
